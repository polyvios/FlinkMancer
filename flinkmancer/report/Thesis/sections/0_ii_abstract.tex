\chapter*{\Large \center Abstract}

Data sets can naturally be represented as graphs where nodes represent instances and links represent relationships between those instances.A recurring issue with this type of data is that links may incorrectly exist between unrelated nodes or that links may be missing between two related nodes. The goal of link prediction is to find those irregularities between the nodes of the graph and also predict possible future links. \newline 
This thesis tries to reproduce the feature extraction algorithm of TwitterMancer[1] using the Apache Flink framework. The objective of this work is to measure the speedup for scaling size input with respect to the number of processors. In addition, it aims to perform calculations for a fixed size input while increasing the resources. This will allow us to work with larger graphs and provide more accurate results.
