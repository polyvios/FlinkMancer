\chapter{Conclusions and Future Work}

\section{Conclusions}
To sum up, in this thesis we created an Apache Flink application that can achieve both weak and strong scaling. We managed to extract features on large size input and showed that we can achieve it on even larger scale when the hard disk space issues are solved. We also showed that it is possible to speed up the process by increasing our resources.  We believe that this project will provide a useful tool for data analysis in the feature.
\section{Future Work}
The immediate work that shall be done is to use the features extracted here and train Logistic Regression models to help with Link Prediction.
